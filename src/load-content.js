/*
Now remove those elements from the HTML
(so leave only the <html>, <body>, and <div id="content"> tags)
and instead create them by using JavaScript only,
e.g. by appending each new element to div#content once the page is first loaded.

Since we’re all set up to write our code in multiple files,
let’s write this initial page-load function inside of its own module and then import and call it inside of index.js.
